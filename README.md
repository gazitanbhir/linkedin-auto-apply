# linkedin-auto-apply
This project uses an AI agent to automatically search and apply for jobs on LinkedIn based on a provided resume (PDF).  It leverages FastAPI for the backend API, Langchain for agent management, and Playwright (via `browser_use`) for browser automation.  The AI agent uses LLM to understand the resume and formulate search queries.
